Contemplating requirements
 

Greetings,

 

Let's do some thinking about requirements. Recall it is all about What the system should do. Beware of the "how" thoughts that will creep in your thoughts.

 

 

Consider some multiplayer games or a virtual environment like secondlife.

 

There are avatars that have various properties. Some of these properties are related to their appearance. Often appearance can be modified.

 

In games there are certain strengths and weaknesses. Also, some weapons.

 

Can you write down some requirements that describe the expected functionality for avatars and/or weapons?

 

I look forward to your contributions. Be creative.

What will the user be able to do? What must the system do? I believe many of the avatars and weapons are pretty creative. So, I am really curious to see what you specify.
